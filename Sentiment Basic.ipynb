    "\n",
    "Ms McEntee said that she hopes there will not be contradictory votes in the House of Commons this week. MPs need to listen to their own experts and business groups “and take that on board when they’re voting.”\n",
    "\n",
    "British prime minister Theresa May’s fragile authority suffered another blow on Monday as three ministers quit to back a Commons amendment enabling MPs to take control of Commons business to stage a series of “indicative votes” on alternatives to her deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms McEntee said that preparations are well under way for Brexit, but warned that there was only so much that could be done until a definite outcome is known. “It takes time to adapt and change.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there is an organised Brexit it will still mean changes, she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Even in a best case scenario there will be changes, people will have to adapt.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This will force businesses to look at their markets and make alternative arrangements rather than be so reliant on one market.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There’s something positive in that, but not the positive we want.”\n",
    "\n",
    "While discussions are ongoing about the levels of support that will be made available if necessary, Ms McEntee said that exact figures are not yet known. “It is very clear that support will be there.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked why Ireland had not benefitted more from companies leaving the UK, she pointed out that “Ireland got its share.”\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be some boost to the economy from such moves, but not enough. “There needs to be a complete restructuring of our economy.\n",

    "Mr Harris also rejected a claim the Government has allotted only €20 million in 2019 to the ambitious blueprint to change the health services from a two-tier, public-private, service to a single-tier service over 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Over €200 million will be spent on Sláintecare this year arising from announcements in the Budget. So much of what we are doing is in capital (spending) in terms of building elective-only hospitals and building primary care centres,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Harris was speaking on Monday after he and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced three changes to patient charges. The announcement was made at a new primary care centre in Grangegorman, Dublin 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes all arose from last October’s budget and comprise: a €10 reduction in the monthly drugs payment scheme threshold, bringing it down to €124; a 10 per cent increase in the weekly income thresholds for GP visit cards; as well as a reduction in prescription charges for medical card holders over 70 years of age. For the latter group, the new prescription charge will reduce from €2 to €1.50.\n",
    "Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Harris was responding to comments by the chairman of the Oireachtas Health Committee, Dr Michael Harty, earlier on Monday who said he was concerned that €20 million was not enough, given projected costs are €3 billion over the next six years of Sláintecare.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is delivering the new GP contract, which I hope the negotiations will conclude in the coming days. These are all parts of Sláintecare,” said Mr Harris.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have a lot to do. It is a 10-year plan. What we have seen in recent weeks is that plan come alive. The action plan published, the integration fund launched, the three announcements today, Laura Magahy and her team in place and doing a very good job,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Harris said the message for people was if they were going to the pharmacy next month, their monthly bill was going to be cheaper. He said over 70s would get cheaper prescriptions and 44,000 families would benefit from a €10-a-month saving in the drug payment scheme threshold.\n",

    "“This is actually the first increase in income thresholds for free GP care since 2006,” he said.\n",

    "Asked about the implications of Brexit for medicine supply in Ireland, he said there was no notification of any medicine shortage associated with Britain leaving the EU.\n",

    "“The advice to patients doctors and everybody else remains the same: not to stockpile because if you stockpile you can inadvertently disrupt the supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "“For most medications in Ireland there is about a 10-12 week supply here in the country,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asked separately on his own views on Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth in the wake of Brexit, he said: “I don’t believe it arises. I don’t wish for it to arise. Indeed my party was the first party to declare a Republic and saw Ireland depart from such structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think there is an important point. We have to find new ways of working with the United Kingdom should they leave the EU. It’s healthy to have debates all these issues. It’s helpful to hear different views at part conferences. There are lots of different views in relation to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have a very strong, deep, historical relationship with the United Kingdom. We want to work out a way of making sure that continues. I don’t think that necessitates us remaining a member of the Commonwealth,” he said.\n",

    "He claimed they shouted: \"This is Maga country\", a reference to President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan, and that at least one of the assailants was white.\n",

    "But Chicago police said Mr Smollett, 36, paid two brothers, both of whom are black, $3,500 to stage the attack because he was \"dissatisfied with his salary\" on the TV show.\n",

    "But his lawyer said outside court on Tuesday that the cheque was for nutrition and physical training.\n",

    "Authorities also said Mr Smollett sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand.\n",
